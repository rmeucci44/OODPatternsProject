    Clone or download the project:

        GitHub link: https://github.itap.purdue.edu/rmeucci44/OODPatternsProject.git

        Or download the ZIP and extract it.

    Open IntelliJ IDEA:

        Click File → Open.

        Navigate to the folder containing the project files and open it.

    Set up the project:

        If prompted, mark the folder as a Java project.

        Make sure a JDK is selected (Java 17 or 21 is recommended).

    Run the program:

        Open BattleGameNew.java.

        Right-click anywhere inside the file and choose Run 'BattleGameNew.main()'.

    ✅ Note: You do not need to compile manually — IntelliJ handles that for you automatically.
